## Description
It is important when creating open source projects on GitHub that  they posess quality README files  composed with information such as: What the app is for.   how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how other developers can lessmake  contributions  to the success of the project

A command-line application was chosen as it will enable a quick and easy generation of a project README to get started promptly. This facilitates a project creator to spend more time on working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

My goal here is to create a command-line application  that dynamically generates a professional README.md from user input via the Inquirer package.

The application will be invoked from the command line like so:

**node index.js**

## Installing Dependencies
 Dependencies maybe installed as follows:
 **npm i**
