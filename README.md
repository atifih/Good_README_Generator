## Description
It is important when creating open source projects on GitHub that  they posess quality README files  composed with information such as: What the app is for.   how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how other developers can lessmake  contributions  to the success of the project

A command-line application was chosen as it will enable a quick and easy generation of a project README to get started promptly. This facilitates a project creator to spend more time on working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

My goal here is to create a command-line application  that dynamically generates a professional README.md from user input via the Inquirer package.

The application will be invoked from the command line like so:
**node index.js**

## Installing Dependencies
 Dependencies maybe installed as follows:
 **npm i**

  ## Usage

  The application begins by prompting the user for github username, emaress il address folled by the title of the project.

  The application prompts installation instructions as well as sensible default options as shown in this pic ieratenside parenthesis.

  The user then proceeds in the application at which point they are prompted to select the license for the application from a list of common application licenses.

  The user then proceeds to enter application usage information as well as guidelines on how one may contribute to the project.

  Finally, a link to the developer's github profile coupled with links to their email address are provided coupled with a message from the application whether the readme file was generated successfully.
